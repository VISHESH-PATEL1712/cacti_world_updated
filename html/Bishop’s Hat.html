      Introduction:
    </b></h1>
    <h4>
    <h4>
      <br>The Bishop's Cap cactus, also known as Astrophytum myriostigma (ass-tro-FY-tum MEE-ree-oh-STIG-mah), is a species of blooming, spineless cactus that is a member of the Cactaceae family.
        
    </h4><br>
    <h4>
      The term Astrophytum, which means star plant in Greek, is interestingly derived from that word.
Like other plants in its genus, the lovely succulent Astrophytum Myriostigma develops in a shape resembling a star.
    </h4><br>
    <h1 class="section__title-left "><b>
      Bishop's Hat cactus:
    </b></h1><br>
    <h4>
      Bishop's cap cactus typically grows to a maximum height of 100 cm (39 inches) and a maximum diameter of 20 cm (8 inches). Age causes its four or five distinct ribs to grow to eight or more. When young, the plant is globose; as it grows more ribs, it becomes cylindroid. White flecks cover the grayish-green flesh.

      <h1 class="section__title-left "><b>
        Physical Characteristics
      </b></h1><br>
      <h4>
        Cacti are perennial succulent plants. Typically, cacti have thick, woody, or herbaceous stems that contain chlorophyll. Areoles, little cushion-like structures containing trichomes (plant hairs) and, in nearly all species, spines or barbed bristles (glochids), distinguish cacti from other succulent plants. 
         
      </h4><br>
      <h4>
        Areoles are modified branches that can develop into flowers, other branches, and leaves (if any are present).The amount of surface area from which water can be lost is minimized in most species by the absence, significant reduction, or modification of leaves into spines, and the stem has taken over the plant's photosynthetic processes.

      <h4>
        From the button-like peyote (Lophophora) and low clumps of prickly pear (Opuntia) and hedgehog cactus (Echinocereus) to the tall columns of barrel cacti (Ferocactus and Echinocactus) and the imposing saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea), cacti vary widely in size and overall appearance. 
      </h4><br>
      <h4>
        The majority of cacti are ground-dwelling plants, although a few tropical species, such as the leaf cactus (Epiphyllum), Rhipsalis, and Schlumbergera, are epiphytes and grow on other plants. 
      </h4><br>
      <h4>
        Other cacti species survive on hard surfaces like rocks, and yet other species climb high up trees. Most epiphytic plants have flattened, almost leaflike stems. The plant's appearance differs depending on whether the surface of the stem is smooth or embellished with projecting tubercles, ridges, or grooves.

        How to take care of  Bishop’s Hat Cactus:
      </b></h1><br>
      <h4>
        Size and Growth:<br>
        •Young Bishop's cap plants have a broadly spherical shape that resembles a globe.

However, when the plant becomes bigger, the white scales with hairs start to resemble a bishop's mitre, which is the traditional headgear used by bishops.

Bishop's Cap plants frequently resemble stars and have five protruding ribs with white spots or dots on them.
      </h4><br>
      <h4>
        Fragrance and Flowering:<br>.
        While the foliage of Astrophytum Myriostigma is lovely on its own, the yellow blossom only enhances its beauty.
        
        The daisy-like flower, which typically has a diameter of no more than 2 inches, emerges at the top of a mature plant.<br>
        
        Each flower has a 2-day blooming period. The blossoming season might extend several months because the flowers bloom one after another.
        
        The flowers are yellow with a scarlet or orange center and bloom in the spring or early summer.

      <h1 class="section__title-left "><b>
        Temperature required for Bishop’s Hat Cactus:
      </b></h1><br>
      <h4>
        <h4>
          Astrophytum myriostigma appreciates warmth and light.

Young plants, however, are unable to withstand intense sunshine. Light shade is ideal for plants; never position them in direct sunlight.

Remember that these plants need a winter break.

Keep the temperature below 50 degrees Fahrenheit as the year winds down in order to give the plant time to rest throughout the winter.
        </h4><br>
        <h4>Watering and Feeding:<br>
          Astrophytum plants don't need a lot of water to be watered or fed. Avoid watering them at all from October through March during the colder months.


          In March, start watering only when necessary. With rising temperatures, gradually increase watering.<br>
          
          Although Astrophytum Myriostigma only needs a little bit of water throughout the summer, it is crucial to ensure that the plant is not overwatered.
          
          Similar to water, these plants don't require a lot of feeding.
          
          During the summer, use a diluted liquid fertilizer with low nitrogen content once a month; once winter arrives, stop.

       <h3>
        •	Soil Requerments: 
      </h3><br>
      <h4>
        Astrophytum Myriostigma thrives in cactus soil or a blend of 25% coarse sand, 25% pumice, and 50% potting soil. It is a native of rocky terrain.

Spread some sand over the top of the dirt in the pot to shield the plant's neck from damage.


      </h4><br>
      <h4>
        Plant Astrophytum Myriostigma in small pots due to the restricted root zone. If repotting is necessary, it is preferable to hold off on transplanting these plants until early spring.
     </h4><br>
     <h4>
      Maintenance and Grooming:<br>
Bishop's Cap plants are relatively self-sufficient when it comes to care and maintenance, despite their modest size (ideal for a window sill).

Nothing much to do besides admire the plant. Because of this, Astrophytum species are among the simplest to cultivate and maintain.
   </h4><br>
   <h1 class="section__title-left "><b>
    Propagation of the Acanthocereus Cactus
  </b></h1><br>
  <h4>
    Astrophytum plants are best propagated from seeds.

Use propagation soil that is sandy and well-drained.

Put seeds in the ground and lightly crush them. Maintain the soil's temperature at about 78 degrees Fahrenheit while keeping it just damp.

The Bishop's Cap seeds should be transplanted to separate pots as they grow and germinate. 
  </h4><br>
  <h4>
    Young plants should be planted in a mixture of:

    •25% fine sand<br>
    •Pumice at 25%<br>
    •one-half potting soil<br>
Don't forget to cover the surface of the dirt with a light layer of sand as well!

While it is advisable to provide young plants as much light as possible, keep in mind.
