      Introduction:
    </b></h1>
    <h4>
    <h4>
      <br>Cacti belonging to the genus Pilosocereus are indigenous to Mexico, the Caribbean, and Brazil. Pilosocereus is a genus of many different species of cacti, some of which are so uncommon that no one outside of botanical sources has ever heard of them.
        
    </h4><br>
    <h4>
      Pilosocereus pachycladus, often known as the blue column cactus, is the most popular houseplant in the genus and is produced in quantity and sold wholesale by big nurseries.
    </h4><br>
    <h1 class="section__title-left "><b>
      Pilosocereus Pachycladus Cactus:
    </b></h1><br>
    <h4>
      The majority of Pilosocereus cacti are shrubby or columnar trees with a height of 1 to 10 (or more) m. The Blue cactus' fertile area frequently differs slightly from the rest of its vegetative components.
       
    </h4><br>
    <h4>
       Its graceful habit (form) gives it the appearance of a little blue saguaro. One of the bluest columnar cacti is this one.
    </h4><br>
    <h4>
      Similar to the "old man cacti" Cephalocereus senilis, the floriferous areoles are typically found on one or more ribs close to the apical part of the branches and generate dense, velvety tufts of orange/white hair. The flowers appear in this region of the cactus.

        Physical Characteristics
      </b></h1><br>
      <h4>
        Pilosocereus pachycladus mainly grows in tall and column manner. Its growth is often vertical and if it is grown its natural enviroment, they can grow upto 30feet which is quivalent to 9 meters.
         
      </h4><br>
      <h4>
        The cactus' segmented stems frequently have a blue-gray color to them. As a result, transpirational water loss and solar absorption are decreased. These stems are covered in spine clusters that give shade and shield the cactus from herbivores.
      </h4><br>
      <h4>
        Small, broad spines on Pilosocereus pachycladus provide a protective barrier against enviromental dangers and harms. It coordinates with the cactus by using pale or grayish apparel.

        How to take care of  Pilosocereus Pachycladus Cactus:
      </b></h1><br>
      <h4>
        The Pilosocereus family of cacti includes a variety of species, however they all generally require the same maintenance (which is also typical of most other cacti).
      </h4><br>
      <h4>
         Your best bet is definitely to grow your pilosocereus cacti indoors, where you can most readily create and maintain the ideal growing circumstances, if you don't live in an exceptionally warm, desert-like region.
      </h4><br>
     
      <h4>
        Water:<br>
The cacti family should be able to get by with weekly watering. During the summer, they require a steady supply of water, but be careful not to overwater them since this might result in rot. Inserting your finger a few inches into the dirt will serve as an excellent test. It is probably time to water if the soil is dry there. 
      </h4><br>
      <h4>
       Fertilizer:<br> Even though members of this cactus family are known for growing swiftly, adding a little more fertilizer won't harm them and might even hasten their growth. For optimal results, supplement their watering once or twice a week during the growing season with a diluted liquid fertilizer. To avoid burning your cactus, use a balanced fertilizer that has been diluted, such as a 20-20-20.
      </h4><br>

      <h1 class="section__title-left "><b>
        Temperature required for Pilosocereus Pachycladus Cactus:
      </b></h1><br>
       <h4>
        Due to their desert habitat, the Pilosocereus family of cacti prefer sweltering temperatures. If it gets too hot for your cactus, don't worry; they can withstand triple-digit heat and like continuous temps over 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Make sure that Pilosocereus' surroundings doesn't get below 50 degrees, though, as it can't stand being cold or frozen.
      </h4><br>
     <h4>
        Light:<br>
Like most cacti, members of the Pilosocereus family need lots and lots of direct sunlight to flourish. The brighter the light, the better, and you should aim for between 10 and 12 hours a day. If you do have a varietal with blue skin, the more sun it gets, the more vibrant the color will be.
      </h4><br>
       <h3>
        •	Soil Requerments: 
      </h3><br>
      <h4>
        A well-draining soil is likely the most crucial element when it comes to growing your cacti. Your Pilosocereus cacti should be kept in a dry soil mixture (such as a combination of perlite, sand, and limestone) with some organic matter incorporated in order for them to be happy plants. You may also place your cacti in a clay or terracotta container to improve drainage. Doing so will aid in wicking extra moisture from the soil and preventing rot.
      </h4><br>
      
   <h1 class="section__title-left "><b>
    Propagation of the Acanthocereus Cactus
  </b></h1><br>
  <h4>
    Cuttings are the most effective method of Pilosocereus cactus propagation. Once the plant has started to mature, you can cut off the top and transplant it as the base of a new plant. The top-cuts should begin to bloom quite soon after they have rooted. To guarantee blossoming in your cacti, cut off the tips of the current plants.
  </h4><br>
  <h4>
    Fairy castle cactus cutting propagation method: First sterilize a sharp pair of gardening scissors or a
     knife. You need to cut a single stem from the parent plant. Let that stem be callous for a few days. Then,
      the plant is in a well-drained sandy loam soil. Follow the watering pattern mentioned above. 
 </h4><br>
 <h4>
  Seed propagation Acanthocereus cactus: The fruits of the cactus bear seeds. These can be sowed in a 
  cactus potting mix. Acanthocereus cactus seeds propagation is a prolonged process.
